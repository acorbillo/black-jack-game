# Blackjack Game

This is a simple Blackjack game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game follows custom rules where the player and the computer can acquire a maximum of three cards each. The player is initially dealt two cards and has the option to draw another card or continue with the current two cards. The game determines the winner based on the sum of the cards, with a sum greater than 21 resulting in an automatic loss for the player. It is a single-player game, played against the computer.
